# E2E Testing Note

## Issue with Local Playwright Installation

The E2E tests were initially failing because they required local browser installations:

```
Error: browserType.launch: Executable doesn't exist at /Users/vishani/Library/Caches/ms-playwright/chromium_headless_shell-1194/chrome-mac/headless_shell
```

This is expected since the assessment requirement states that evaluators only have Docker and GNU tools available - they don't have Node.js or npm to install Playwright browsers.

## Solution: Docker-Based E2E Testing

I've created a Docker-based E2E testing solution that works in a Linux environment with only Docker available:

### Files Created:

- `e2e/Dockerfile` - Playwright test runner container
- `e2e/docker-compose.test.yml` - Test environment orchestration
- `run-e2e-tests.sh` - Script to run E2E tests in Docker
- `verify-complete.sh` - Complete verification including E2E tests

### How It Works:

1. **Playwright Container**: Uses official Playwright Docker image with browsers pre-installed
2. **Isolated Test Environment**: Separate Docker network for testing
3. **Service Dependencies**: Tests wait for application services to be healthy
4. **HTML Reports**: Test results available via web interface

### Usage:

```bash
# Run E2E tests in Docker
./run-e2e-tests.sh

# Or complete verification including E2E tests
./verify-complete.sh
```

### Benefits:

- ✅ No local browser installation required
- ✅ Works in Linux environment with only Docker
- ✅ Isolated test environment
- ✅ HTML test reports
- ✅ Cross-browser testing capability
- ✅ CI/CD ready

This solution ensures that E2E tests can be run by evaluators who only have Docker and GNU tools available, meeting the assessment requirements perfectly.
